Criminal Profile:
Dorian Vex, known as "The Marrow Collector," is a serial killer linked
to at least nine homicides across three states between 2018 and 2024.
His victims, all middle-aged men with no clear connection, were found
exsanguinated with precise spinal incisions. Each body was missing a
single rib. Police found cryptic Latin phrases carved into nearby surfaces.

Modus Operandi:
Vex strikes every 11 months, always on a lunar eclipse. His expertise
in anatomy suggests a medical background. Victims show no signs of
struggle, indicating the use of sedatives. A collection of human ribs,
polished and arranged in Fibonacci spirals, was discovered in a storage
unit in Detroit.

Known Affiliations:
A former member of an occult medical society, Vex vanished in 2015
after a malpractice case involving experimental surgeries. CCTV footage
from Cleveland (Jan 2024) captured a figure resembling him, walking with
a slight limp, suggesting a recent injury.

Threat Level: EXTREME
Dorian Vex is highly intelligent and resourceful. He has evaded capture
for six years and is considered armed and dangerous. If spotted,
do not engage. Contact FBI Task Force Omega immediately.
